# propresenter_lib v2

This is a Python library designed to help generate ProPresenter files.  This is version 2, as the initial (incomplete) version needed a minor rewrite to allow for multiple versions, since (at the time of this writing) ProPresenter 6 is right around the corner!

## Purpose

This project was created to streamline a repetitive, weekly ProPresenter building process.  The scope of the current project is mostly for adding single media elements on each slide - not lyrics or other text.  I may add those capabilities in the future.

## Examples

No examples yet.
